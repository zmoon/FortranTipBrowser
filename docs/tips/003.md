# 003. `do`-`enddo` loop

Tweet: <https://twitter.com/fortrantip/status/1471891644370796550>

The primary looping construct in Fortran is do ... end do.
A program to print the sum the squares of the integers from 1 to 5 is

```fortran
implicit none
integer :: i, ssq
ssq = 0
do i = 1, 5
   ssq = ssq + i**2
end do
print *, "sum of squares is ", ssq
end
```

Ouput:
```text
 sum of squares is           55

```
