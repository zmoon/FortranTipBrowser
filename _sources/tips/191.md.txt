# <span class='text-muted'>191.</span> Derived type array sections are allowed before or after the % component selector, but not in both places.

<span style='font-size: small;' class='text-muted'>topic: {ref}`derived-types`</span>

For an array of derived types that have array components, you can refer to an array section at either level, but both array sections cannot have rank &gt; 0. The array sections

t(1:n)%c(1)
t(1)%c(1:2)

are valid for array component c(:) but not

t(1:n)%c
