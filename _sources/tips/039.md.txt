# 039. Name modules and the source files containing them consistently, with one module per file.

Name modules and the source files containing them consistently, with one module per file. The convention I use is that a module named  m_mod is defined in a source file m.f90. That way if I see 

use m_mod, only: foo

in my code I know to look in m.f90 for the definition of foo.
