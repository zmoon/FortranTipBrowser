# 013. New Fortran code should use free source form and `.f90` suffix

New Fortran code should be written using free source form and stored in a file with a `.f90` file extension.
Free form was introduced in the Fortran 90 standard,
but using the `.f90` suffix does NOT mean the code is restricted to Fortran 90 features.
Don't use the `.f95`, `.f08`, `.f18` suffixes, which are not recognized by many tools.
