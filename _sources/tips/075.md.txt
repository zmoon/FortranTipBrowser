# 075. KIND numbers of types are not portable across compilers and should not be used directly.

KIND numbers of types are not portable across compilers and should not be used directly. It's better to use the named constants from iso_fortran_env. For both gfortran and Intel Fortran

use iso_fortran_env
print*,int8,int16,int32,int64

gives 1 2 4 8, but NAG gives 1 2 3 4.
