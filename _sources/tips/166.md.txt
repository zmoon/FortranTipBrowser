# <span class='text-muted'>166.</span> Beware of a loop to huge(i), since huge(i)+1 is out of range.

<span style='font-size: small;' class='text-muted'>topic: {ref}`loops`</span>

To loop from 1 to a large number, with the loop terminated by an EXIT, write

do i=1,huge(i)-1
   ! code
   if (cond) exit
end do

It is invalid for the upper bound to be huge(i), since i is set to huge(i)+1 upon exit, which is out of range.
