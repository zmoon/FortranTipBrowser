# 072. Fortran 2008 introduced z%re and z%im as alternatives to real(z) and aimag(z)

Fortran 2008 introduced z%re and z%im as alternatives to real(z) and aimag(z) to refer to the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable z, either scalar or array. The %re and %im syntax does not apply to expressions, so (2*z)%im is disallowed.
