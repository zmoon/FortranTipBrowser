<span style='font-size: small;' class='text-muted'>topic: {ref}`fortran-resources`</span>

Two good sites to get started with Fortran are
<https://fortran-lang.org> and <https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/HomePage>.
A good free compiler is `gfortran`, part of GCC.
Intel Fortran is also free.
LFortran is an interactive compiler that covers most but not yet all of Fortran.
