# 084. DIMENSION can be used to declare several arrays of the same SHAPE

DIMENSION can be used to declare several arrays of the same SHAPE, which can be overridden on the same line.

real, dimension(3,4) :: x, y, z(5,6)

is legal but should be written

real, dimension(3,4) :: x, y
real :: z(5,6)

for clarity.
