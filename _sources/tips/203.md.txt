# <span class='text-muted'>203.</span> Use ifort -fast or gfortran -O3 -march=native for speed.

<span style='font-size: small;' class='text-muted'>topic: {ref}`compiling`</span>

Use the ifort -fast and gfortran -O3 -march=native options to increase speed. Gfortran -Ofast turns on -ffast-math and can give a further 2x speedup in some cases, but it can also give incorrect results and should be used with care. Use gfortran -Og to debug.
